      <p id= "Effective" class="innetexts"><em>Effective Date: Dec 12th, 2023</em></p>

      <p id="EnkaarePortal" class="innetexts">These Enkaare Client Portal Terms of Service (the “Terms”) define the terms and conditions under which Enkaare L.L.C. (“Enkaare”)
         offers and you (“you” or “Client”) agree to use Enkaare’s Client Portal services, as described in these Terms (the “Services”),
          and are part of and incorporate by reference the website <a href="">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=""> Privacy Policy</a>. If You are an existing
           Enkaare Client, these Services are in addition to and, except where explicitly stated, do not supersede, replace, or limit other
            similar terms in the Master Services Agreement agreed to between You and Enkaare. Any conflict or inconsistency between these 
            Terms and any prior-executed Master Services Agreement shall be resolved in favor of the Master Services Agreement.
          <br>
          <br>
          IN ORDER TO USE ENKAARE’S CLIENT PORTAL, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS,
           YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE ENKAARE CLIENT PORTAL.
        </p>

      <h2 id="howitWorks">1. SERVICES; HOW IT WORKS</h2>

      <p class="innetexts">
        With Enkaare’s Client Portal you will have access to automated eligible Talent recommendations based on 
        the criteria you input into the Enkaare Client Portal. If you select a Talent through the Enkaare Client 
        Portal, Enkaare will staff the selected Talent with you for the term and the billing rate specified at 
        checkout. If Enkaare will be providing managed services for particular systems, licenses, projects, or 
        products (“Managed Services”), additional terms may apply.
      </p>
  
      <h2 id="personnel">2. PERSONNEL</h2>
      <p class="innetexts">Enkaare will source, assess, engage and select Talent according to the terms specified by you at 
        checkout. Talent may include Enkaare’s employees, independent contractors, subcontractors, or agents. 
        If Client is not completely satisfied with a particular Talent during the two (2) week trial (“Trial Period”), 
        Client will describe the reasons for the dissatisfaction to Enkaare within 24 hours after requesting a 
        replacement. Replacement requests are subject to the notice period set forth in Section 4.1 below. 
        Enkaare encourages Client and Talent to resolve service disputes mutually or with the support of your 
        Enkaare representative. Enkaare shall use reasonable efforts to provide the Services through the same 
        personnel for the duration of an engagement, provided that Enkaare shall be entitled to replace such 
        personnel with personnel of equivalent qualification and experience on no less than five (5) business 
        days’ notice to Client.</p>
  
      <!-- ... other sections ... -->
  
      <h2 id="billingPayment">3. BILLING AND PAYMENT</h2>
      <p class="innetexts">
        
        <strong>3.1 Monthly Fees.  </strong>For any Talent you select and engage through Enkaare, Client agrees to make payments in 
        accordance with the pricing and payment terms specified in your invoice, which are based on the hiring 
        confirmation that you received. All Fees are due and payable by Client on a monthly basis within 15 
        days of receipt of an invoice for such Fees. If Client provides pre-payment of at least six (6) months 
        of Fees, Client may receive a discount equal to a two percent (2%) reduction in their Fees 
        (“Pre-Payment Discount”), provided that said discount cannot be combined with the Prompt Payment Discount. 
        Late payments accrue interest at a rate of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest applicable lawful rate.

        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>3.2 Fee Disputes. </strong> Client shall notify Enkaare of any disputed Fees in writing (along with substantiating documentation) 
        within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of an invoice. Client will be deemed to have accepted all invoices for 
        which Enkaare does not receive timely notification of dispute, and Client shall pay all undisputed amounts due under 
        such invoices by the due date set forth on the invoice. The parties shall seek to resolve all such disputes expeditiously 
        and in good faith.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3.3 Expenses. </strong> Client must pre-approve in writing all expenses for reimbursement. Enkaare is entitled to reimbursement from 
        Client only for documented “out-of-pocket” and travel expenses that are reasonably incurred and necessary for Enkaare’s 
        performance of the Services. Enkaare will support all requests for reimbursement of travel expenses with documentation 
        including receipts for expenses.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>3.4 Taxes. </strong> Client is not liable for taxes relating to Enkaare’s net income. Client shall be responsible for sales, use, or value added taxes 
        it owes in connection with the Services that the law requires Enkaare to collect from Client. In the event that Enkaare is required at 
        any time to pay any tax for which Client is responsible, Client shall promptly reimburse Enkaare for such payments, subject to the 
        provision to Client of supporting documentation evidencing such payments.
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>3.5 Uplift.</strong> On each anniversary of the effective date of the commencement of Services, the Fees will increase by a minimum of six percent 
        (6%) to account for Talent performance and annual market adjustments. Enkaare will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of such increase.



      </p>

      <h2 id="termsTermin">4. TERMS AND TERMINATION</h2>
      <p class="innetexts">
        <strong>4.1 Termination for Convenience.</strong> These Terms shall remain in effect and govern Services provided to Client by Enkaare until the Talent engagement is 
        terminated, or the Parties agree otherwise (the “Term”). An engagement with Talent may be terminated by either Party upon 30 days’ prior written 
        notice to the other Party.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>4.2 Termination for Cause.</strong> With the exception of monetary breaches as described below, either party may terminate a Talent engagement upon the other 
        party’s breach of any material provision of these Terms. The non-breaching party must give 14 calendar days written notice (describing the 
        breach in detail) and the opportunity to cure the breach. Enkaare may terminate a Talent engagement if Client fails to make a monetary 
        payment within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. Enkaare shall give Client 14 calendar days written notice (describing the amounts owed) 
        and the opportunity to cure the breach.
        <br>
        <br>
       <strong>4.3  Monetary Breach.</strong> Enkaare may terminate this Agreement or any SOW if Client fails to make a monetary payment within fifteen (15) days of receipt of an 
        undisputed invoice. Enkaare shall give Client fourteen (14) calendar days’ written notice (describing the amounts owed) and the opportunity to cure the breach.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>4.4 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination of the engagement for any reason, Client shall immediately pay to Enkaare all amounts owed to Enkaare pursuant to 
        Section 3 hereof for Services performed prior to the effective date of termination including any applicable expense reimbursement. In the case of 
        termination for Client’s breach, Client shall also be responsible for Enkaare’s reasonable costs relating to enforcing Client’s obligations, including 
        the collection of unpaid charges due and payable in connection with the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, termination shall not affect rights 
        and/or obligations of the Parties which arose prior to any such termination, including without limitation warranties, indemnities, limitations of liability, 
        which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement and such rights and/or obligations shall survive any such termination.

      </p>



      <h2 id="intellectualProp">6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
      <p class="innetexts">
        <strong>6.1 Assignment to Client.</strong> All intellectual property rights in any deliverables delivered by Talent (“Deliverable”) or arising out of the 
        Services performed by the Talent will become the property of Client immediately upon full payment of all amounts due and owing. 
        Immediately upon such payment, Enkaare hereby assigns to Client, or its designee, all rights, title and interest of Enkaare in and to any 
        and all such intellectual property rights throughout the world. Enkaare agrees that, to the full extent permitted under applicable law, 
        all Deliverables shall constitute “works made for hire” (assuch term is defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101) for Client. To the extent that any 
        Deliverable does not constitute a “work made for hire” for Client, Enkaare hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys 
        (and agrees to assign, transfer, and convey, without further consideration) to Client, on a worldwide and perpetual basis, all right, title, 
        and interest in and to any and all Deliverables (including all intellectual property rights therein). Enkaare agrees to execute such further 
        documents or take such further actions (at Client’s expense) that may be necessary to register or enforce Client’s intellectual property rights in the Deliverables.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>6.2 Client Materials.</strong> Client shall retain ownership of all content and materials provided to Enkaare and Enkaare Talent. Client takes full responsibility for 
        any content (including, without limitation, graphics, audio, copy text, video, and images) provided to Enkaare to be used for the Services. Client represents 
        and warrants that it has full rights to exploit all content and materials provided to Enkaare.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>6.3 Enkaare Pre-Existing Rights.</strong> Enkaare shall retain any of its pre-existing intellectual property rights and any residual rights provided that to the extent any 
        such intellectual property rights are embodied in the Deliverables, Enkaare hereby grants Client a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide license to 
        use such pre-existing intellectual property rights to the extent necessary for the use of the Deliverables.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>6.4 Enkaare Software Ownership and Licenses.</strong> Any software provided by Enkaare (“Software”) and all worldwide intellectual property rights therein are the exclusive property of Enkaare. 
        All rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Enkaare. You acknowledge that the Software and its structure, organization and source 
        code constitute valuable trade secrets of Enkaare. Accordingly, except as expressly allowed under these Terms, you will not, either directly or through a third party: (i) copy, 
        modify, adapt, alter, translate or create derivative works from the Software; (ii) distribute, sublicense, lease, rent, loan or otherwise transfer the Software to any third party; 
        or (iii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Software. In the event of expiration or termination of these Terms for any 
        reason, the Software licenses granted under these Terms will automatically and immediately cease and you must destroy all copies of the Software or related documentation in your 
        possession.
      </p>



      <h2 id="warranties">7. WARRANTIES</h2>
      <p class="innetexts">
        <strong>7.1 </strong>You warrant and represent that you are a business entity and have the full authority to order Services and engage Talent, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, 
        and that these Terms are not in conflict with any other agreement to which you may be bound.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>7.2 </strong>Enkaare warrants and represents further that: (i) each of the Talent assigned to perform any part of the Services shall have the proper skill, training and background for such Talent’s 
        level of competence as specified on the Enkaare Client Portal so as to be able to perform in a competent and professional manner; (ii) Client shall receive good and marketable title 
        to all copyrights in original materials included in any Deliverables or developed under these Terms, free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever 
        of a third party; (iii) all Deliverables and Services provided by Enkaare to Client by its personnel are delivered or provided “as is” and “where is” and may or may not be error-free; 
        and (iv) ENKAARE MAKES NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN. SPECIFICALLY, ENKAARE DISCLAIMS ALL GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS AND 
        WARRANTIES (WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR IN WRITING, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WHETHER 
        OR NOT ARISING THROUGH A COURSE OF DEALING), RELATING SOMEHOW TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS.
       </p>



       <h2 id="limitationL">8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES</h2>
       <p class="innetexts">
        Except for liabilities resulting from either Party’s actual intentional and/or willful misconduct, fraud or a breach of Confidentiality obligations, each Party’s liability 
        hereunder shall not exceed the fees paid or payable by Client within the one-year period immediately preceding the date that the alleged wrongful act first occurred. 
        NEITHER CLIENT NOR ENKAARE SHALL BE LIABLE TO ONE ANOTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES OF ANY 
        KIND OR ANY LOST OR IMPUTED PROFITS ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR ANY 
        OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ANY 
        CLAIMS THAT THESE EXCLUSIONS DEPRIVE SUCH PARTY OF AN ADEQUATE REMEDY.
       </p>



       <h2 id="indemnification">9. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
       <p class="innetexts">
        Enkaare agrees to indemnify Client, and Client’s directors, officers, affiliates, employees, personnel and agents against any and all losses, damages, penalties, settlements, costs 
        and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)(collectively, “Losses”), and to defend Client in any suit, claim, or proceeding, brought by any third party or governmental agency, 
        arising from Enkaare’s breach of its obligations under these Terms and/or Enkaare’s violation of any applicable law or regulation. Client agrees to indemnify Enkaare, and Enkaare’s 
        directors, officers, affiliates, employees, personnel and agents against any and all Losses, and to defend Enkaare in any suit, claim, or proceeding, brought by any third party or 
        governmental agency, arising from Client’s breach of any provision of these Terms, and/or Client’s violation of any applicable law or regulation. In consideration of these 
        indemnification obligations, each Party must provide the indemnifying Party prompt notice of the assertion of any claim and permit the indemnifying Party to assume the full control 
        of the defense and/or settlement thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnifying Party shall not enter into a settlement which would affect any rights of the indemnified 
        Party without such indemnified Party’s prior written consent.
       </p>

       <h2 id="confidentialy">10. CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
       <p class="innetexts">
        In connection with entering into and performing under these Terms, each Party may receive or have access to commercially valuable technical and nontechnical confidential or proprietary 
        information of the other Party (including confidential or proprietary information of a third party), including information in whatever form, relating to the business of such Party that 
        is not generally known or available to others, including but not limited to, source code and documentation for software, trade secrets, know how, customer lists, pricing strategies, 
        payment terms, the terms of these Terms, marketing and business plans, information concerning such Party’s vendors, and such Party’s contemplated plans, strategies and prospects 
        (“Confidential Information”). Except as expressly and unambiguously provided herein, the receiving Party will hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information of the 
        disclosing Party and will similarly bind its personnel, including each Enkaare Talent. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Confidential Information received or obtained from 
        the other Party will be the sole and exclusive property of the other Party and may not be used, disseminated or disclosed except as may be necessary to perform the obligations required 
        under these Terms or as may be required by law. If disclosure is required by law, the Party required to disclose Confidential Information shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party 
        (at the other Party’s request and expense) so that the other Party may preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information to the extent reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the 
        foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that:
        <br>
        (a) is in the public domain prior to the disclosure or becomes part of the public domain through no wrongful act of the receiving Party;
         
        (b) was in lawful possession of the receiving Party prior to the disclosure;
        
        (c) was independently developed by the receiving Party outside the scope of these Terms; or 
    
        (d) was disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party who was in lawful possession of the information.

       </p>



       <h2 id="noexlusivity">11. NO EXCLUSIVITY</h2>
       <p class="innetexts">
        Enkaare’s Services, including but not limited to as such are described under the terms of these Terms, are not and shall not be deemed to be exclusive to Client nor to Client’s affiliates. 
        Enkaare is and shall remain free to render similar services to other entities, and to engage in all such activities as Enkaare deems appropriate, provided that in doing so Enkaare does not 
        breach any covenants or obligation expressly set forth in these Terms. Enkaare shall not have any duty or obligation to disclose to Client any confidential or proprietary information that 
        Enkaare may acquire about the business, operations or activities of any other person or entity, even if such information could be deemed material and relevant information to Client.
       </p>



       <h2 id="nonSolity">12. NON-SOLICIT</h2>
       <p class="innetexts">
        You may not offer Talent to pay, or make payment using any method other than through Enkaare. In case you have been asked to use an alternative payment method, please report it immediately 
        to your Enkaare representative. Client acknowledges that Enkaare invests significant resources in sourcing Talent. During the Term and for one year thereafter, Client shall not, directly 
        or indirectly, encourage or solicit to hire, or otherwise hire or engage for services (excluding the Enkaare Services hereunder), encourage or otherwise induce to terminate a relationship 
        with Enkaare, any Talent who Client is introduced to through Enkaare in connection with the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, general solicitations that do not specifically target
